Phonepe Pulse Data Visualisation and Exploration Analysis!
In this project I've visualized the online transactions done in Phonepe using GUI.
The Phonepe pulse Github repository contains a large amount of data related to various metrics and statistics. The goal is to extract this data and process it to obtain insights and information that can be visualized in a user-friendly manner.
I have created a dashboard to visualize Phonepe pulse Github repository data using Streamlit and Plotly in Python.
Basically, Transaction Analysis & User Data Analysis
In the Transaction Analysis: The Transactions data mainly contains the total transactions count and total amount in each state and district, 
and in User Data Analysis: The Users data mainly contains the Registered Users count and App openings via different mobile brands
